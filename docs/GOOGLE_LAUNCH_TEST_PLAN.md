## Assertions Summary
| # | Type | Target | Expected |
|---|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | URL | Page URL | Contains "google.com" |
| 2 | Title | Page Title | Contains "Google" |
| 3 | Visible | Google logo/branding | Is visible on page |
| 4 | Visible | Search input | Is visible and interactable |
| 5 | Visible | Search button | At least one is visible |

## Self-Healing Strategy
- Use flexible selectors (role-based, aria-label, title attributes)
- Use `toContain` instead of exact text match for title/text assertions
- Implement proper wait strategies (domcontentloaded + networkidle)
- Add generous timeouts for navigation (30s) and element visibility (15s)
- Fall back to text-based selectors if role-based ones fail

## Estimated Execution Time
~15 seconds (per test case)

## Teardown
- Close browser context after test completion
